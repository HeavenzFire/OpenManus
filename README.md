# Spirit Angelus

**Spirit Angelus** is an advanced AI project that integrates various interdisciplinary technologies—including sacred geometry, quantum computing, machine learning, and resonance-based systems—to create a cohesive, self-adaptive framework. The purpose of this project is to dynamically process and optimize input data, revealing patterns of harmony and balance that echo the fundamental principles of nature.

## Main Function Points

- **Sacred Geometry Processing:**  
  Processes input data based on sacred geometry principles, creating patterns that emphasize harmony, balance, and cyclic symmetry.

- **Quantum-Inspired Optimization:**  
  Uses quantum-inspired methods and libraries like Qiskit to optimize data and simulate quantum processes, harnessing the power of quantum computation for advanced problem-solving.

- **Adaptive Machine Learning:**  
  Utilizes deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch to dynamically adjust and improve the system over time, enabling continual learning and system evolution.

- **Resonance and Fourier Transforms:**  
  Applies Fourier Transforms to amplify and refine signals, enhancing communication, signal integrity, and overall system performance.

- **Dynamic Visualization:**  
  Uses visualization libraries like Matplotlib to represent sacred geometry patterns and system outputs visually, offering intuitive insights into the system's internal state.

## Technology Stack

- **Sacred Geometry**
- **Quantum Computing**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Resonance-based Systems**
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Qiskit**
- **Matplotlib**
